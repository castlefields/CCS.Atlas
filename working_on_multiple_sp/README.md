# Modular Stored Procedures for Account ECOF Application Paid Report

This directory contains the modular version of the original monolithic stored procedure `rpt_mth_account_ecof_application_paid_0401_2135.sql`. The functionality has been split into several focused procedures to improve readability, maintainability, and testability.

## Procedures Overview

### Main Procedure
- **rpt_mth_account_ecof_application_paid** - Main entry point that coordinates the entire report generation process

### Supporting Procedures
- **rpt_get_filtered_moments** - Filters dates based on the specified period
- **rpt_get_facilities_for_report** - Handles facility selection logic
- **rpt_get_budget_data** - Retrieves and aggregates budget data
- **rpt_get_ecof_data** - Retrieves and aggregates ECOF data
- **rpt_get_application_data** - Retrieves and aggregates application data
- **rpt_get_paid_data** - Retrieves and aggregates payment data
- **rpt_build_final_results** - Combines all data sets and builds the final results

## Benefits of Modular Approach

1. **Improved Readability**: Each procedure has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one aspect of the report don't require modifying the entire procedure
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
4. **Reusability**: The supporting procedures could be reused in other reports
5. **Clearer Error Handling**: Error handling can be more specific to each stage of the process
6. **Better Performance Tuning**: Each procedure can be optimized independently
7. **Easier Debugging**: When issues arise, it's easier to identify which part is failing

## Implementation Notes

- All procedures share the same functionality as the original monolithic procedure
- Temporary tables are used for data sharing between procedures
- Each procedure is focused on a specific aspect of the report
- The main procedure handles parameter validation and coordinates the process

## Testing Strategy

1. Run both the original and new procedures with identical parameters
2. Compare the results to ensure they match
3. Test each procedure independently with various input scenarios
4. Test edge cases to ensure robust behavior
